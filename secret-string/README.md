# Kata (4ryu): Secret String

[*â€”your secrets are never safe*]

## Summary

The Kata is inspired by the one of kata codewars: There is a secret string which is unknown to you. Given a collection of random triplets from the
string, recover the original string.

A triplet here is defined as a sequence of three letters such that each letter occurs somewhere
before the next in the given string. "whi" is a triplet for the string "whatisup". As a simplification, you may assume:

- **no letter occurs more than once** in the secret string.
- nothing about the triplets given to you other than that they are valid triplets.
- they contain sufficient information to deduce the original string.

In particular, this means that the secret string will never contain letters that do not occur in one of the triplets given to you.

secret_1 = "whatisup"

triplets_1 = [
['t','u','p'],
['w','h','i'],
['t','s','u'],
['a','t','s'],
['h','a','p'],
['t','i','s'],
['w','h','s']
]

[Project Plan](https://github.com/mikel-k-khui/kata/projects/2)

### Key Learning:

- Further apply CS/math strucutre theory to problem and data structure to simplify solution
- Apply separation of concerns and OOP

## Project Setup

### Dependencies

none

### DevDependencies

- eslint
- prettier
- husky

### Installation

1. Download zipped file or clone this private repo.

2. Navigate to the fluent-calculator folder `cd secret-string`.

3. Install node dependencies: `npm install`.

4. Run the jest test: `npm run test` from fluent-calculator folder or `npm run secret-string-test` from root folder.

5. Run the console test: `node src/index.js` from fluent-calculator folder or `npm run secret-string` from root folder.

## Testing

- Developed with TDD
- Unit testing with Jest: get/set methods, unit test, and integrate unit tests for interaction between classes.
